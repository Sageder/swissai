### Problem:
Blatten, Switzerland 2025 showed the gap: nine days advance warning, yet five days of coordination chaos led to inadequate flood protection, failed resource planning (emergency helicopter cow airlifts!), and citizens forced to evacuate in just 2 hours. Switzerland spends CHF 349 million annually on natural disasters, with current systems sending alerts but leaving coordination to emails and phone calls.

### What We Built:
missionAlps transforms natural disaster warnings into coordinated emergency responses through AI-driven automation. When Switzerland's 6,000+ monitoring sites detect threats like glacier collapses, floods, or avalanches, our system instantly notifies all stakeholders and orchestrates resource allocation.
